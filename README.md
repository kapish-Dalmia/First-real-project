# First-real-project

this is my real project after learning the basics of git and github

I would like to learn more about it and get into some intermediate and advanced git and github.

This would be the first real repo where i store my upcoming progress and some projects( hope so ).

also would like to get help from the community though i know nobody is going to see it.

I don't know what am i goin to put here but i have some simple python projects made and i think that i should upload them to save the progress.

I would be keeping all my python code in the main branch and all the other files like jupyter files in the subsquent branchs.
