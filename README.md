Here I would be storing my jupyter projects and i mainly use jupyter for machine learning projects .

first i hhave to know how and if we can add jupyter files to github.
 
I understood how to modify the jupyter files or update them
1. first i have to open the notebook which is in the directory where git is initialised.
2. I can make my desired changes 
3. come to vscode or cmd and you will see the changes that u have made(modified or updated)
4. u can view the status and it will show the changes
5. now u can add , commit and push as we normally do.
